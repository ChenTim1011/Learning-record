[Special Array I](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-i/description/)



```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isArraySpecial(vector<int>& nums) {
        // If the array has only one element, it is considered special by definition.
        if(nums.size() == 1){
            return true;
        }
        
        // Iterate through the array until the second-to-last element.
        // We compare each element with its adjacent next element.
        for(int i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); i++){
            // Check if both adjacent elements have the same parity.
            // The expression 'nums[i] % 2' gives 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers.
            // If nums[i] and nums[i+1] have the same remainder when divided by 2,
            // it means they are both even or both odd.
            if(nums[i] % 2 == nums[i+1] % 2){
                // Since the adjacent numbers have the same parity,
                // the array is not special. Return false.
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // If we have checked all adjacent pairs and none of them have the same parity,
        // the array is special. Return true.
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Base Case for Single Element:**
   - If the array has only one element (`nums.size() == 1`), it is considered special by definition. This is because there are no adjacent pairs to compare, so the condition is trivially met.

2. **Looping Through the Array:**
   - The loop goes from `i = 0` to `i + 1 < nums.size()` which ensures we always have a valid adjacent element (`nums[i+1]`) to compare.
   
3. **Checking Parity:**
   - For each adjacent pair (`nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`), we use the modulo operator `%` with `2` to determine their parity. 
     - If `nums[i] % 2 == 0`, `nums[i]` is even.
     - If `nums[i] % 2 == 1`, `nums[i]` is odd.
   - If both `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` have the same result (both even or both odd), then the array is not special and we return `false`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any adjacent pair with the same parity, the function returns `true`, indicating that the array is special.

This solution efficiently checks the condition in one pass through the array with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
