[11.Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## **Problem Statement**  
We are given an array `height` of size `n`, where each index `i` represents a vertical line at `(i, height[i])`.  

We need to find two **lines** that form a **container** with the x-axis, which holds the **maximum** amount of water.  

### **Rules:**
- The width of the container is determined by the distance between the two chosen lines.
- The height of the container is determined by the **shorter** of the two lines.
- We cannot tilt the container.

## **🔹 Example Walkthrough**  
### **Example 1**  
#### **Input:**  
```cpp
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
```
#### **Visual Representation:**
```
|
|       |                       
|       |        |       |
|       |        |   |   |
|   |   |        |   |   |
|   |   |    |   |   |   |
|   |   |    |   |   |   |
|   |   |    |   |   |   |   |
|___|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|__
```

#### **Best Choice:**
- **Choose the bars at index `1` (height `8`) and index `8` (height `7`).**
- The **width** is `8 - 1 = 7`.
- The **height** is `min(8,7) = 7`.
- **Max area = 7 × 7 = 49.**

#### **Output:**
```cpp
49
```

---

### **Example 2**  
#### **Input:**  
```cpp
height = [1,1]
```
#### **Best Choice:**
- Choose both bars at index `0` and `1` (both have height `1`).
- Width = `1 - 0 = 1`.
- Height = `min(1,1) = 1`.
- **Max area = 1 × 1 = 1.**

#### **Output:**  
```cpp
1
```

## **Approach: Two Pointers (Greedy Strategy)**
### **Key Observations**
1. **The amount of water stored depends on both width and height.**
2. **The shorter line is the limiting factor** in water storage.
3. **By moving the shorter line inward**, we increase the chance of finding a taller line and potentially increasing the area.

### **Algorithm**
- Use **two pointers**, `left` (starting at `0`) and `right` (starting at `n-1`).
- Calculate the **current area**:
  - `width = right - left`
  - `height = min(height[left], height[right])`
  - `area = width × height`
- Move the **pointer pointing to the shorter height** inward to possibly find a taller line.
- Keep track of the **maximum area found**.

---

## **C++ Solution**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxWater = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int width = right - left;
            int h = min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = width * h;
            maxWater = max(maxWater, area);

            // Move the pointer pointing to the shorter height
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxWater;
    }
};
```

---

## **Code Explanation**
### **1️⃣ Initialize Pointers and Variables**
```cpp
int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
int maxWater = 0;
```
- `left` starts at the beginning.
- `right` starts at the end.
- `maxWater` stores the **maximum water area found**.

---

### **2️⃣ Iterate While Left < Right**
```cpp
while (left < right) {
```
- **Continue** the loop until `left` and `right` meet.

---

### **3️⃣ Calculate the Current Area**
```cpp
int width = right - left;
int h = min(height[left], height[right]);
int area = width * h;
maxWater = max(maxWater, area);
```
- **Width:** Distance between the two bars.
- **Height:** The **shorter** bar determines the water level.
- **Calculate area** and update `maxWater`.

---

### **4️⃣ Move the Shorter Bar**
```cpp
if (height[left] < height[right]) {
    left++;
} else {
    right--;
}
```
- **Why move the shorter bar?**
  - The **shorter bar is the limiting factor**.
  - Moving the **taller bar does not increase the area**.
  - **Moving the shorter bar gives a chance of finding a taller one**.

---

## **Complexity Analysis**
| Complexity | Analysis |
|------------|----------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(n)** – We traverse the array once using two pointers. |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(1)** – We only use a few integer variables. |

---

## **Why is this the Optimal Solution?**
- **Brute Force Approach** would check all possible pairs `(i, j)`, resulting in **O(n²)** time complexity.
- **The Two-Pointer Approach efficiently finds the optimal solution in O(n) time** by always moving the shorter bar.

---

## **Summary**
✅ **Two-pointer strategy** ensures we always consider the widest possible width first and adjust based on height.  
✅ **Moves the pointer with the smaller height**, ensuring potential for a taller container.  
✅ **Achieves O(n) time complexity**, significantly improving over O(n²) brute force methods.
