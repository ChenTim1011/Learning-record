[872. Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## **üìå Problem Statement**
Two binary trees are considered **leaf-similar** if their **leaf value sequences** (the values of all leaf nodes from left to right) are the same.

### **üîπ Example 1**
```
Input:
root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]
root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]

Tree 1:        Tree 2:
     3              3
    / \            / \
   5   1          5   1
  / \ / \        / \ / \
 6  2 9  8      6  7 4  2
   / \                  / \
  7   4                9   8

Leaf sequence of Tree 1: **[6,7,4,9,8]**
Leaf sequence of Tree 2: **[6,7,4,9,8]**

Output: `true` (Both have the same leaf sequence)
```

## **üöÄ Approach**
### **üîë Key Idea**
- Extract **leaf values** from both trees using **DFS (Depth-First Search)**.
- Compare the extracted sequences.

### **üîπ Steps**
1. **Extract Leaf Values**:
   - Perform a **DFS (Preorder or Inorder)** traversal.
   - Collect all **leaf nodes** (nodes with no children).
2. **Compare the Two Sequences**:
   - If they are identical, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## **üíª Code (C++)**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void getLeaves(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& leaves) {
        if (!root) return;
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            leaves.push_back(root->val);
        }
        getLeaves(root->left, leaves);
        getLeaves(root->right, leaves);
    }

    bool leafSimilar(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        vector<int> leaves1, leaves2;
        getLeaves(root1, leaves1);
        getLeaves(root2, leaves2);
        return leaves1 == leaves2;
    }
};
```

## **‚è≥ Complexity Analysis**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Explanation |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **DFS (Recursive)** | **O(N + M)** | **O(N + M)** | Traverses both trees once to extract leaves and stores them in vectors. |

## **‚úÖ Summary**
| Method | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **DFS (Recursive)** | **O(N + M)** | **O(N + M)** | Simple and efficient |

This approach efficiently extracts **leaf values** and checks for similarity in **O(N + M)** time, making it optimal for trees up to **200 nodes**. üöÄ
