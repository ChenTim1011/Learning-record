[1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## **Problem Breakdown**
We are given two **strings** `word1` and `word2`. Our goal is to **merge them alternately** as follows:
1. Take one character from `word1`, then one from `word2`, and repeat.
2. If one string is longer than the other, **append the remaining characters** to the end of the merged string.
3. Return the final merged string.

## **Understanding with Examples**
### **Example 1**
#### **Input**
```cpp
word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
```
#### **Merging Process**
| `word1`  | a  | b  | c  |
|----------|----|----|----|
| `word2`  | p  | q  | r  |
| **Merged** | a  | p  | b  | q  | c  | r  |

#### **Output**
```cpp
"apbqcr"
```

---

### **Example 2**
#### **Input**
```cpp
word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
```
#### **Merging Process**
| `word1`  | a  | b  |    |    |
|----------|----|----|----|----|
| `word2`  | p  | q  | r  | s  |
| **Merged** | a  | p  | b  | q  | r  | s  |

- `word2` is longer, so `"rs"` is appended to the end.

#### **Output**
```cpp
"apbqrs"
```

---

### **Example 3**
#### **Input**
```cpp
word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
```
#### **Merging Process**
| `word1`  | a  | b  | c  | d  |
|----------|----|----|----|----|
| `word2`  | p  | q  |    |    |
| **Merged** | a  | p  | b  | q  | c  | d  |

- `word1` is longer, so `"cd"` is appended to the end.

#### **Output**
```cpp
"apbqcd"
```

## **Approach: Two-Pointer Technique**
### **Why Use Two Pointers?**
- We need to **iterate through both strings at the same time**.
- The easiest way to do this is with **a single index** tracking both strings.

### **ðŸ“Œ Steps to Implement**
1. **Initialize an empty string** `result` to store the merged output.
2. Use **a single loop** to iterate through both `word1` and `word2` simultaneously.
3. **At each step**, append:
   - The current character from `word1`, if available.
   - The current character from `word2`, if available.
4. **Continue until we reach the end** of both words.

## **Code Implementation**
### **C++ Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < word1.size() || index < word2.size()) {
            if (index < word1.size()) {
                result += word1[index];
            }
            if (index < word2.size()) {
                result += word2[index];
            }
            index++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**
### **Time Complexity**
- The loop runs **at most `O(n + m)`** times, where:
  - `n = word1.size()`
  - `m = word2.size()`
- Each iteration takes **O(1) constant time**.
- **Total Time Complexity: `O(n + m)`** âœ…

### **Space Complexity**
- We use **`result` to store the merged string**, which takes **O(n + m) space**.
- No additional arrays or data structures are used.
- **Total Space Complexity: `O(n + m)`** âœ…

---

## **Another Approach: Using a For Loop**
We can achieve the same result using a **for loop** instead of `while`.

### **C++ Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result;
        int n = word1.size(), m = word2.size();
        int minLength = min(n, m);

        // Merge characters alternately
        for (int i = 0; i < minLength; i++) {
            result += word1[i];
            result += word2[i];
        }

        // Append remaining characters
        if (n > m) result += word1.substr(minLength);
        else if (m > n) result += word2.substr(minLength);

        return result;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Use a for loop** to iterate **only up to the length of the shorter string** (`minLength`).
2. **Use `substr(minLength)`** to append the remaining part of the longer string.
3. The solution remains **O(n + m) in time and space complexity**.

## **Summary**
âœ… **Two-pointer approach allows efficient merging**  
âœ… **Optimized version avoids unnecessary checks**  
âœ… **Time Complexity: `O(n + m)`, Space Complexity: `O(n + m)`**  
âœ… **Handles cases where one string is longer efficiently**
