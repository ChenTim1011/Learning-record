[443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)



## **Problem Statement**
We are given an array of characters `chars`, and we need to **compress it in-place** using the following rules:

1. **If a character appears consecutively multiple times**, replace it with the character followed by its frequency.
2. **If a character appears only once, keep it unchanged.**
3. **The compressed result should be stored in `chars`, modifying it in-place, and we must return the new length of `chars`.**
4. **If the frequency is greater than or equal to 10, store each digit separately** (e.g., `"bbbbbbbbbbbb"` → `["b", "1", "2"]`).

---

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Example 1**
#### **Input**
```cpp
chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
```
#### **Process**
1. `"aa"` is compressed to `"a2"`
2. `"bb"` is compressed to `"b2"`
3. `"ccc"` is compressed to `"c3"`

#### **Output**
```cpp
Return 6; compressed chars = ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
```

---

### **Example 2**
#### **Input**
```cpp
chars = ["a"]
```
#### **Process**
- Since `"a"` appears only once, it remains unchanged.

#### **Output**
```cpp
Return 1; compressed chars = ["a"]
```

---

### **Example 3**
#### **Input**
```cpp
chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
```
#### **Process**
1. `"a"` remains unchanged.
2. `"bbbbbbbbbbbb"` (12 times) is compressed to `"b12"`.

#### **Output**
```cpp
Return 4; compressed chars = ["a","b","1","2"]
```

## **Approach**
We need an efficient way to **compress the character array in-place**, ensuring:
- **O(1) extra space usage** (we cannot use extra arrays).
- **O(n) time complexity** (we must iterate through `chars` efficiently).

### **Steps**
1. **Use `idx` to mark the position to write compressed characters**.
2. **Traverse `chars` using `i` to track characters**:
   - Count consecutive occurrences of each character.
   - When a new character is encountered, store the previous character and its count.
3. **If count > 1, store its digits separately in `chars`**.
4. **Return `idx`, the new length of `chars`**.

---

## **C++ Solution**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        int n = chars.size();  // Get the size of the array
        int idx = 0;  // `idx` keeps track of where to write compressed characters
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char ch = chars[i];  // Current character
            int count = 0;  // Track the frequency of `ch`
            
            // Count consecutive occurrences of `ch`
            while (i < n && chars[i] == ch) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }
            
            // Store the character
            chars[idx++] = ch;
            
            // If the character occurs more than once, store the count as separate digits
            if (count > 1) {
                string str = to_string(count);  // Convert number to string
                for (char dig : str) {  // Store each digit separately
                    chars[idx++] = dig;
                }
            }
            
            i--;  // Move `i` back to process the next character correctly
        }
        
        return idx;  // Return the new length of the compressed array
    }
};
```

## **Code Explanation**
### **1️⃣ Initialization**
```cpp
int n = chars.size();
int idx = 0;
```
- `n` stores the length of `chars`.
- `idx` keeps track of the position where the compressed characters are stored.

---

### **2️⃣ Iterate through `chars`**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    char ch = chars[i];  
    int count = 0;
    
    while (i < n && chars[i] == ch) {  
        count++;  
        i++;  
    }
```
- **`ch` stores the current character**.
- **Count how many times `ch` appears consecutively**.

---

### **3️⃣ Store the Character**
```cpp
chars[idx++] = ch;
```
- **Always store the character at `idx`**.

---

### **4️⃣ Store Frequency if Greater than 1**
```cpp
if (count > 1) {  
    string str = to_string(count);  
    for (char dig : str) {  
        chars[idx++] = dig;  
    }  
}
```
- **Convert `count` into a string** (e.g., `12` → `"12"`).
- **Store each digit separately in `chars`**.

---

### **5️⃣ Adjust `i`**
```cpp
i--;
```
- **Since `i` was incremented one extra time in the `while` loop, we move it back**.

---

## **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**
| Complexity | Analysis |
|------------|----------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(n)**, since each character is processed at most twice (once for counting and once for writing). |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(1)**, as we modify `chars` in-place without extra storage. |

---

## **Summary**
✅ **This problem focuses on "run-length encoding" compression, modifying the array in-place.**
- **Iterate through `chars` and count consecutive occurrences of each character.**
- **Store the character and its count (if greater than 1) in `chars`.**
- **Ensure that counts are stored as separate digits.**
- **Use an index (`idx`) to track where to write compressed data and return the final length.**
