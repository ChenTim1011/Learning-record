[841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## **📌 Problem Statement**
We have `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n-1`.  
- **Initially, only room `0` is unlocked.**  
- **Each room contains a set of keys** to other rooms.  
- Our goal is to **determine if we can visit all the rooms**.

### **🔹 Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example 1**
```cpp
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
```
#### **Explanation**
- Start in **room 0** → pick up key `1`.
- Enter **room 1** → pick up key `2`.
- Enter **room 2** → pick up key `3`.
- Enter **room 3** → No more keys, but we visited all rooms.

✅ **Return `true`**.

---

#### **Example 2**
```cpp
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
```
#### **Explanation**
- Start in **room 0** → pick up keys `{1,3}`.
- Enter **room 1** → has keys `{3,0,1}` but we already have them.
- Enter **room 3** → has key `0`, but we already have it.
- **Room `2` is locked and we don’t have its key.**

❌ **Return `false`**.

## **🚀 Approach**
### **🔑 Key Observations**
- The problem is about **graph traversal**.
- Each **room is a node** and **keys are edges** connecting to other nodes.
- We must check if we can **visit all nodes (rooms)**.
- **Use BFS or DFS** to traverse the graph.

---

## **💡 BFS (Breadth-First Search) Approach**
1. **Start from Room 0**:  
   - Use a **queue** to track rooms to visit.
   - Use a **visited set** to track visited rooms.
   
2. **Process each room**:
   - Mark the room as **visited**.
   - Add all **keys from this room** to the queue **if they unlock an unvisited room**.

3. **Check if all rooms are visited**.

---

### **📝 BFS Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        queue<int> q;
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        q.push(0); // Start from room 0
        visited[0] = true;
        int visitedCount = 1; // We visited room 0

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int room = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int key : rooms[room]) {
                if (!visited[key]) { 
                    visited[key] = true;  
                    q.push(key);  
                    visitedCount++; 
                }
            }
        }

        return visitedCount == n;
    }
};
```

## **💡 DFS (Depth-First Search) Approach**
1. **Use recursion** or a **stack** to explore rooms.
2. **Mark visited rooms** in a boolean array.
3. **Visit each unvisited room** using DFS.

---

### **📝 DFS Code (Recursive)**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int room, vector<vector<int>>& rooms, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[room] = true;

        for (int key : rooms[room]) {
            if (!visited[key]) {
                dfs(key, rooms, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        dfs(0, rooms, visited); // Start DFS from room 0

        for (bool v : visited) {
            if (!v) { 
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true; 
    }
};
```

## **⏳ Complexity Analysis**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **BFS** | **O(n + E)** (Each room is visited once, each key processed once) | **O(n)** (Queue + Visited array) |
| **DFS (Recursive)** | **O(n + E)** | **O(n)** (Recursion stack + Visited array) |

🔹 `E` is the **total number of keys in all rooms** (edges in the graph).  
🔹 `O(n + E)` ensures we **only process each room and key once**.

---

## **✅ Summary**
| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **BFS (Queue)** | **Easy to implement, avoids recursion stack overflow** | Uses extra queue memory |
| **DFS (Recursive)** | **More intuitive for traversal** | Can cause stack overflow for large `n` |

👉 **BFS is preferred for larger inputs to avoid recursion depth issues.** 🚀
