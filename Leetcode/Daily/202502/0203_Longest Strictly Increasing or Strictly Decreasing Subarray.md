[Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-strictly-increasing-or-strictly-decreasing-subarray/description/)


### **Step-by-step Explanation**

1. **Understand the Problem**  
   You need to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray that is either:
   - Strictly increasing (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), or  
   - Strictly decreasing (e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`).

2. **Iterate through the Array**  
   To identify strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarrays, iterate through the array and compare adjacent elements.

3. **Tracking the Length**  
   Use two variables to keep track of the current length of strictly increasing and strictly decreasing subarrays:
   - `inc_len` for increasing length  
   - `dec_len` for decreasing length  

4. **Update the Longest Length**  
   At every step, update a `max_len` variable to store the maximum length seen so far.

5. **Reset the Lengths**  
   If a comparison breaks the strictly increasing or decreasing condition, reset the respective length to 1.

### **Python Implementation**

Here is the code with detailed comments for each step:

```python
def longest_strictly_increasing_or_decreasing_subarray(nums):
    # Initialize the maximum length variable
    max_len = 1  # At least one element subarray always exists
    # Variables to track the current increasing and decreasing subarray lengths
    inc_len = 1  # Length of current strictly increasing subarray
    dec_len = 1  # Length of current strictly decreasing subarray

    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
            # Current element is greater than the previous one -> strictly increasing
            inc_len += 1  # Increment increasing length
            dec_len = 1  # Reset decreasing length
        elif nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
            # Current element is less than the previous one -> strictly decreasing
            dec_len += 1  # Increment decreasing length
            inc_len = 1  # Reset increasing length
        else:
            # Current element is equal to the previous one -> neither increasing nor decreasing
            inc_len = 1  # Reset both lengths
            dec_len = 1

        # Update the maximum length found so far
        max_len = max(max_len, inc_len, dec_len)

    return max_len  # Return the maximum length found

# Example Test Cases
print(longest_strictly_increasing_or_decreasing_subarray([1, 4, 3, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2
print(longest_strictly_increasing_or_decreasing_subarray([3, 3, 3, 3]))      # Output: 1
print(longest_strictly_increasing_or_decreasing_subarray([3, 2, 1]))         # Output: 3
```

### **Explanation of Key Parts**

1. **Initialization**  
   - `max_len = 1`: The minimum possible length is 1 since every subarray contains at least one element.
   - `inc_len` and `dec_len` are initialized to 1 to account for the first element.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**  
   - Compare `nums[i]` with `nums[i-1]`:
     - If `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`: Increase the length of the strictly increasing subarray and reset the decreasing length.
     - If `nums[i] < nums[i-1]`: Increase the length of the strictly decreasing subarray and reset the increasing length.
     - If `nums[i] == nums[i-1]`: Reset both lengths to 1, as the condition for strictness is broken.

3. **Updating the Maximum Length**  
   - Update `max_len` at each step with the larger value between the current `inc_len`, `dec_len`, and the previous `max_len`.

4. **Returning the Result**  
   - The `max_len` variable holds the length of the longest subarray that satisfies the conditions.

### **Time Complexity**
- **O(n)**: The algorithm iterates through the array once.

### **Space Complexity**
- **O(1)**: Only a few variables are used, and no additional data structures are required.
