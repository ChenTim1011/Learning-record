### ðŸ“Œ **Abstract**  

**MLIR** (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is an innovative approach for building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure. **The goal of MLIR** is to address multiple issues, including software fragmentation, improving compilation performance for heterogeneous hardware, reducing the cost of developing domain-specific compilers, and facilitating the integration of existing compilers. Specifically, MLIR aims to enhance the design and implementation of **code generators, translators, and optimizers** across different abstraction levels, application domains, hardware targets, and execution environments.  

### **Contributions**  

This paper makes two main contributions:  

1. **Discussion of MLIR as a research tool**:  
   - **MLIRâ€™s design and challenges**: The article discusses MLIR as a research tool designed for extensibility and evolution. It highlights the challenges and opportunities that arise from this novel design, covering aspects such as design principles, semantics, optimization specifications, system architecture, and engineering considerations.  

2. **Evaluation of MLIR as a general-purpose infrastructure**:  
   - **Reducing compiler development costs**: The article evaluates how MLIR, as a general-purpose infrastructure, effectively lowers the cost of compiler development. Through various use cases, the article demonstrates the research and educational opportunities MLIR presents for future programming languages, compilers, execution environments, and computing architectures.  

### **Design Principles**  

The paper also introduces **the design principles of MLIR**, including its **structure** and **semantics**, and explains how these principles support MLIRâ€™s role as a fundamental component in compiler infrastructure.

## ðŸ“Œ **Introduction**  

This chapter introduces the **MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation)** system and explores its impact on compiler design, language design, and implementation challenges. It also discusses how MLIR addresses these challenges.

### **The Current State of Compiler Design**  

Compiler design is a well-established field with numerous widely known algorithms applied to **code generation, static analysis, and program transformation**. Many **mature technology platforms**, such as **LLVM** and **JVM**, are extensively reused within the compiler community. These platforms share common characteristics:  

- **Single abstraction level**: LLVM provides an intermediate representation (IR) roughly equivalent to "C with vectors," while the JVM offers an object-oriented type system with garbage collection abstractions. These simple and general abstractions make compilation clearer and easier to handle.  

### **The Challenges of a "One-Size-Fits-All" Approach**  

While this **single abstraction model** is effective for straightforward scenarios, it lacks the precision needed for specialized high-level and low-level problems. For example:  

- **Source-level analysis of C++ code** is difficult to perform at the LLVM IR level.  
- **High-level languages** (such as Swift, Rust, Julia, and Fortran) often develop their own IRs to address domain-specific issues, such as language/library optimizations, type checking, and improvements in lowering processes.  

To accommodate specialized optimization needs, many projects create their own **custom IRs**, but this approach incurs **high development costs** and makes maintaining efficient compiler infrastructure difficult.  

### **The Birth and Objectives of MLIR**  

**The goal of MLIR** is to directly tackle these challenges in language design and implementation. MLIR enables compiler developers to introduce **new abstraction levels at a low cost** while providing **built-in infrastructure** to address common compiler engineering issues. The key approaches include:  

1. **Standardizing the Static Single Assignment (SSA) structure**: Ensuring IR consistency and usability.  
2. **Defining a declarative system for IR dialects**: Offering an efficient syntax design and extension mechanism.  
3. **Providing comprehensive infrastructure**: Including documentation, parsing and printing logic, location tracking, multi-threaded compilation support, and pass management.  

### **Key Contributions**  

This paperâ€™s primary contributions include:  

- Introducing a **novel compiler infrastructure** with significant value in both industry and academia.  
- Proposing **a new approach to constructing scalable and modular compiler systems**.  
- Exploring MLIRâ€™s applications across multiple domains, demonstrating its versatility.  
- Sharing experiences in developing systems based on the MLIR infrastructure.  

### **The Origins of MLIR**  

MLIR was conceived from observations of modern machine learning frameworks. These frameworks consist of multiple compilers, graph processing technologies, and runtime systems, yet **they lack a shared infrastructure or unified design**. Many of these frameworks **do not follow best compiler design practices**, leading to issues such as:  

- Unclear error messages  
- Unexpected edge-case failures  
- Performance instability  
- Inability to scale efficiently to new hardware architectures  

The design issues in frameworks like **TensorFlow** highlighted that while existing compiler systems (such as LLVM) successfully unify implementations across multiple programming languages, high-level languages (such as C++, Swift, and Rust) still require their own IRs. This redundancy increases **development and maintenance costs**.  

Thus, we decided to develop **a more general solution** that not only improves existing systems but also addresses urgent challenges, such as **heterogeneous compilation for specialized accelerators**.

### **Conclusion**  

MLIR is designed to address fundamental issues in existing compiler infrastructures. It provides **a more general and flexible framework** that benefits **language designers, compiler developers, and academia**, supporting **scalability and extensibility** across various domains. This makes compiler technology more **efficient, maintainable, and future-proof**.
