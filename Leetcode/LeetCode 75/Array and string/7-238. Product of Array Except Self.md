[Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## **Problem Statement**  
We are given an integer array `nums`, and we need to return an output array `answer` such that each `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.  

### **Constraints:**  
- We **cannot** use the division operation.  
- We must solve it in **O(n) time complexity**.  
- The output array does **not count** as extra space for space complexity analysis.  

---

## **Approach**  
The key idea is to compute the **prefix product** (left-side products) and the **suffix product** (right-side products) separately and multiply them.  

Since we are not allowed to use division, we can use two passes:  
1. First pass (left-to-right): Compute the **prefix product** of elements before each index.  
2. Second pass (right-to-left): Compute the **suffix product** of elements after each index and multiply it with the prefix product.  

By doing so, each element in the output array will be equal to the product of all elements **except itself**.

## **Step-by-Step Algorithm**  

### **Step 1: Initialize the output array**
```cpp
vector<int> output(nums.size(), 1);
```
We initialize an output array of the same size as `nums`, where each element is **1**.  
This array will store the final product results.  

---

### **Step 2: Compute the prefix product (left-to-right pass)**
```cpp
int left = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    output[i] *= left;  // Multiply the current output value with the left product
    left *= nums[i];    // Update left product for the next index
}
```
- We initialize `left = 1`, which represents the product of elements **to the left** of the current index.  
- For each index `i`:  
  - `output[i] *= left`: Multiply the current output value by the left product.  
  - `left *= nums[i]`: Update `left` to include `nums[i]`.  

#### **Example Calculation:**  
Given `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, the first loop modifies `output` as follows:  
| Index | `left` before update | `output[i]` (after multiplying `left`) | `left` after update |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 0 | 1  | `output[0] = 1 * 1 = 1` | `left = 1 * 1 = 1` |
| 1 | 1  | `output[1] = 1 * 1 = 1` | `left = 1 * 2 = 2` |
| 2 | 2  | `output[2] = 1 * 2 = 2` | `left = 2 * 3 = 6` |
| 3 | 6  | `output[3] = 1 * 6 = 6` | `left = 6 * 4 = 24` |

**After first pass:**
```cpp
output = [1, 1, 2, 6]
```

---

### **Step 3: Compute the suffix product (right-to-left pass)**
```cpp
int right = 1;
for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    output[i] *= right;  // Multiply with right product
    right *= nums[i];    // Update right product for the next index
}
```
- We initialize `right = 1`, which represents the product of elements **to the right** of the current index.  
- For each index `i`:  
  - `output[i] *= right`: Multiply the current output value by the right product.  
  - `right *= nums[i]`: Update `right` to include `nums[i]`.  

#### **Example Calculation:**  
Starting with `output = [1,1,2,6]`, the second loop modifies `output` as follows:  
| Index | `right` before update | `output[i]` (after multiplying `right`) | `right` after update |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 3 | 1  | `output[3] = 6 * 1 = 6`  | `right = 1 * 4 = 4` |
| 2 | 4  | `output[2] = 2 * 4 = 8`  | `right = 4 * 3 = 12` |
| 1 | 12 | `output[1] = 1 * 12 = 12` | `right = 12 * 2 = 24` |
| 0 | 24 | `output[0] = 1 * 24 = 24` | `right = 24 * 1 = 24` |

**Final output after second pass:**
```cpp
output = [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

---

## **Final Code (C++)**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> output(nums.size(), 1);

        int left = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            output[i] *= left;
            left *= nums[i];
        }

        int right = 1;
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output[i] *= right;
            right *= nums[i];
        }

        return output;        
    }
};
```

## **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity: O(n)**  
  - We traverse the array twice (left-to-right and right-to-left), so the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.  
- **Space Complexity: O(1)**  
  - The problem states that the **output array does not count** toward extra space.  
  - We only use two extra integer variables (`left` and `right`), which is **O(1)** space complexity.  

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Two-pass solution:**  
   - **Left-to-right pass** computes the product of elements **before** the current index.  
   - **Right-to-left pass** computes the product of elements **after** the current index and combines it with the left product.  
2. **Avoids division operation.**  
3. **Uses only O(1) extra space** (excluding the output array).
