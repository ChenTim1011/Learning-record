[Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-ii/description/)

### **Deep Explanation of the Problem**

This problem is about transforming an array so that all its elements become greater than or equal to a given threshold \( k \). The transformation is done using a specific operation that involves combining the two smallest elements.

#### **Understanding the Operations**
In each operation:
1. Pick the two smallest numbers, \( x \) and \( y \), from the array.
2. Remove both numbers from the array.
3. Compute a new number using the formula:
   \[
   \text{new number} = \min(x, y) \times 2 + \max(x, y)
   \]
4. Insert the newly computed number back into the array.

This operation effectively merges the two smallest numbers into a larger number, gradually increasing the overall values in the array.

#### **Goal**
The objective is to determine the **minimum number of operations** required so that **all** elements in the array become **greater than or equal to** \( k \).

### **Observations and Key Insights**
1. **Always pick the smallest two numbers:**  
   Since we need to reach \( k \) as fast as possible, merging the smallest numbers first ensures the smallest elements grow as efficiently as possible.

2. **Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) for Efficiency:**  
   - A **Min-Heap** (priority queue) allows us to efficiently extract the two smallest numbers.
   - Heap operations (insertion and extraction) have a time complexity of \( O(\log n) \), making this approach efficient.

3. **The formula \( \min(x, y) \times 2 + \max(x, y) \) helps grow values quickly:**  
   - The term \( \min(x, y) \times 2 \) guarantees some growth.
   - Adding \( \max(x, y) \) further ensures that the new number is larger than both \( x \) and \( y \).

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Building the Min-Heap:** \( O(n) \)
- **Extracting Two Elements:** \( O(\log n) \) per operation
- **Inserting One Element:** \( O(\log n) \) per operation
- **Total Complexity:** Since we perform operations until all numbers are \( \geq k \), in the worst case, we do this \( O(n) \) times, resulting in a complexity of:
  \[
  O(n \log n)
  \]
  This is efficient given the constraints (\( n \) up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \)).

Below is your original C++ code with added English comments for better understanding.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Min-heap (priority queue) to store numbers in ascending order
        priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<>> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        int ans = 0; // Count of operations
        
        // Continue operations until the smallest number in the heap is >= k
        while (pq.top() < k) {
            // Extract the two smallest numbers
            long long x = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            long long y = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            // Compute the new number based on the given formula
            long long newNum = min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y);
            
            // Insert the new number back into the heap
            pq.push(newNum);
            
            // Increment operation count
            ans++;
        }
        
        return ans; // Return the minimum number of operations
    }
};
```

### **Step-by-Step Example Execution**
#### **Example 1:**
**Input:** `nums = [2,11,10,1,3]`, `k = 10`

**Step-by-step execution:**
1. **Initial Min-Heap:** `[1, 2, 3, 10, 11]`
2. **First Operation:**  
   - Pick `1` and `2`
   - Compute: `1 * 2 + 2 = 4`
   - Insert `4`
   - Heap becomes `[3, 4, 10, 11]`
   - Operations: `1`
3. **Second Operation:**  
   - Pick `3` and `4`
   - Compute: `3 * 2 + 4 = 10`
   - Insert `10`
   - Heap becomes `[10, 10, 11]`
   - Operations: `2`
4. **All elements are now `>= 10`, so stop.**
5. **Output:** `2`

---

#### **Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,2,4,9]`, `k = 20`

**Step-by-step execution:**
1. **Initial Min-Heap:** `[1, 1, 2, 4, 9]`
2. **First Operation:**  
   - Pick `1` and `1`
   - Compute: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Insert `3`
   - Heap becomes `[2, 3, 4, 9]`
   - Operations: `1`
3. **Second Operation:**  
   - Pick `2` and `3`
   - Compute: `2 * 2 + 3 = 7`
   - Insert `7`
   - Heap becomes `[4, 7, 9]`
   - Operations: `2`
4. **Third Operation:**  
   - Pick `4` and `7`
   - Compute: `4 * 2 + 7 = 15`
   - Insert `15`
   - Heap becomes `[9, 15]`
   - Operations: `3`
5. **Fourth Operation:**  
   - Pick `9` and `15`
   - Compute: `9 * 2 + 15 = 33`
   - Insert `33`
   - Heap becomes `[33]`
   - Operations: `4`
6. **All elements are now `>= 20`, so stop.**
7. **Output:** `4`

### **Why This Approach Works Well**
- Using a **min-heap ensures** that we always operate on the smallest numbers, leading to efficient growth.
- The **merge formula quickly increases the values**, minimizing the number of operations.
- The **priority queue operations (logarithmic complexity) ensure efficiency** for large inputs.

---

### **Alternative Approaches**
1. **Sorting + Greedy:** Sorting initially and then merging the smallest elements iteratively.  
   - **Drawback:** Sorting takes \( O(n \log n) \), and merging needs additional steps.
2. **Brute Force:** Iterating over the array and manually finding the smallest numbers in each step.  
   - **Drawback:** Inefficient \( O(n^2) \) complexity.

Using a **min-heap** (priority queue) is the optimal approach due to its efficiency in extracting and inserting elements.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
This problem is a classic **heap-based greedy problem**, where **always picking the smallest elements ensures optimal results**. The provided solution using a **priority queue** (min-heap) efficiently finds the answer in **\( O(n \log n) \) time complexity**, making it well-suited for large constraints.
