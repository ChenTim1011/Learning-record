[Minimize XOR](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-xor/description/)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        int b = __builtin_popcount(num2);
        int A=0;
        for(int i=31;i>=0 && b>0 ; i--){
            if(num1 & (1<<i)){
                b--;
                A = A | (1<<i);
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<=31 && b>0 ; i++){
            if((A & (1<<i)) == 0 ){
                b--;
                A = A | (1<<i);
            }
        }
        return A;
    }
};

1. `int minimizeXor(int x, int y)`
   - This is the main function that takes two integer parameters x and y

2. `int b = __builtin_popcount(y);`
   - `__builtin_popcount` is a built-in function in GCC compiler
   - Used to count how many 1's are in the binary representation of an integer
   - For example: y = 7 (binary: 0111) -> __builtin_popcount(y) = 3

3. `int A = 0;`
   - Initialize result variable A to 0
   - This variable will store our final answer to return

4. First loop:
```cpp
for(int i = 31; i >= 0 && b; i--)
    if(x & (1 << i))
        b--, A |= (1 << i);
```
- `i` counts down from 31, meaning we check from the leftmost bit
- `b > 0` ensures we still need to set 1's
- `x & (1 << i)` checks if the i-th bit of x is 1
  - For example: if i = 3, then `1 << 3` = 1000
- If it is 1, then:
  - `b--` decreases the count of 1's we need to set
  - `A |= (1 << i)` sets a 1 at the corresponding position in A

1. Second loop:
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i <= 31 && b; i++)
    if((A & (1 << i)) == 0)
        b--, A |= (1 << i);
```
- Checks each bit in A from right to left
- If we still need to set more 1's (b > 0)
- `(A & (1 << i)) == 0` checks if the i-th bit of A is 0
- If it is 0, then:
  - `b--` decreases the count of 1's we need to set
  - `A |= (1 << i)` sets a 1 at that position

1. `return A;`
   - Returns the final result

Let me illustrate with a concrete example:
Suppose x = 9 (1001), y = 7 (0111)

1. First count the number of 1's in y: b = 3
2. First loop:
   - Check positions in x: 1001
   - Set corresponding 1's in A: 1001
   - Now b = 1 (still need to set one more 1)
3. Second loop:
   - Find the leftmost 0 position
   - Set it to 1: 1011
4. Return A = 11 (1011)

This ensures that A has the same number of 1's as y while minimizing A XOR x.

The time complexity is O(1) since we only iterate through 32 bits at most. The space complexity is also O(1) as we only use constant extra space.
