[1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

## **üìå Problem Statement**  
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if they are **close**, and `false` otherwise. Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

1. **Swap any two existing characters** in a string.
2. **Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character**, and do the same with the other character.

You can perform these operations as many times as necessary.

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**  
#### **Input:**  
```cpp
word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
```
#### **Explanation:**  
- Apply **Operation 1**: `"abc" -> "acb"`
- Apply **Operation 1** again: `"acb" -> "bca"`

Thus, `word1` can be transformed into `word2`.

#### **Output:**  
```cpp
true
```

---

### **Example 2**  
#### **Input:**  
```cpp
word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
```
#### **Explanation:**  
It is impossible to transform `word1` into `word2` since `word1` has fewer characters.

#### **Output:**  
```cpp
false
```

---

### **Example 3**  
#### **Input:**  
```cpp
word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
```
#### **Explanation:**  
- Apply **Operation 1**: `"cabbba" -> "caabbb"`
- Apply **Operation 2**: `"caabbb" -> "baaccc"`
- Apply **Operation 2** again: `"baaccc" -> "abbccc"`

Thus, `word1` can be transformed into `word2`.

#### **Output:**  
```cpp
true
```

## **Optimized Approach**  
### **Key Observations**
1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in both `word1` and `word2`.
2. **Presence of Characters:**
   - If any character exists in one string but not in the other, return `false`.
3. **Sorting Frequencies:**
   - Sort the frequency counts of both strings and compare them.

### **Conditions for Words to Be Close:**
- Both strings must contain exactly the same set of characters.
- The frequency of each character in `word1` must be able to match the frequency in `word2`, albeit potentially in a different order (i.e., after sorting).

## **Optimized C++ Solution**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool closeStrings(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
        std::vector<int> freq1(26, 0);
        std::vector<int> freq2(26, 0);

        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character in word1
        for (char ch : word1) {
            freq1[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Step 2: Count the frequency of each character in word2
        for (char ch : word2) {
            freq2[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Step 3: Check if both strings have the same set of characters
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if ((freq1[i] == 0 && freq2[i] != 0) || (freq1[i] != 0 && freq2[i] == 0)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Sort the frequency vectors and compare
        std::sort(freq1.begin(), freq1.end());
        std::sort(freq2.begin(), freq2.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq1[i] != freq2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## **Explanation of Code**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Count Frequencies in Both Strings**
```cpp
std::vector<int> freq1(26, 0);
std::vector<int> freq2(26, 0);

for (char ch : word1) {
    freq1[ch - 'a']++;
}

for (char ch : word2) {
    freq2[ch - 'a']++;
}
```
- **Count occurrences of each letter** in both `word1` and `word2` using arrays `freq1` and `freq2`.
- The size of the frequency array is fixed to 26, one for each letter in the English alphabet.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Presence of Characters**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if ((freq1[i] == 0 && freq2[i] != 0) || (freq1[i] != 0 && freq2[i] == 0)) {
        return false;
    }
}
```
- **Ensure that both strings contain the same set of characters.**
- If a character appears in one string but not the other, return `false`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Sort and Compare Frequencies**
```cpp
std::sort(freq1.begin(), freq1.end());
std::sort(freq2.begin(), freq2.end());

for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    if (freq1[i] != freq2[i]) {
        return false;
    }
}
```
- **Sort the frequency arrays** to make sure the order of frequencies does not matter.
- If the sorted frequencies of `word1` and `word2` match, the strings are close; otherwise, they are not.

## **Complexity Analysis**
| Complexity | Explanation |
|------------|------------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(n)** ‚Üí We iterate through both strings to count frequencies and then sort two fixed-size arrays (of size 26). Sorting has constant time complexity since it is limited to the 26 lowercase English letters. |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(1)** ‚Üí The space used is constant, as the frequency arrays have a fixed size of 26. |

---

## **Edge Cases Considered**
‚úÖ **Strings of Different Lengths:**  
   - Example: `word1 = "a"`, `word2 = "aa"` ‚Üí Returns `false`.

‚úÖ **Strings with Different Characters:**  
   - Example: `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "xyz"` ‚Üí Returns `false`.

‚úÖ **Strings with Identical Character Sets but Different Frequencies:**  
   - Example: `word1 = "aabb"`, `word2 = "bbaa"` ‚Üí Returns `true` after the appropriate character swaps.

---

## **Summary**
‚úÖ **Efficient frequency counting and sorting to determine if strings are close**  
‚úÖ **Time complexity of `O(n)` due to frequency counting and constant-time sorting**  
‚úÖ **Handles edge cases such as different characters and string lengths**
