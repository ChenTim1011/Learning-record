[Count Servers that Communicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-servers-that-communicate/description/)

### Problem description

This problem aims to determine the total number of servers in a network that can communicate with at least one other server. Two servers can communicate if they are in the same row or the same column. The input is an `m x n` 2D grid where `1` represents a server, and `0` represents an empty cell.

Here is an analysis of the code logic and steps:

---

### Code Overview
1. **Create Row and Column Count Arrays**:
   - Use two 1D arrays, `rows` and `cols`, to store the count of servers in each row and each column, respectively.

2. **Count Servers in Rows and Columns**:
   - Iterate through the entire `grid` using nested loops.
   - For every cell with a value of `1` (indicating a server), increment the corresponding count in `rows[i]` and `cols[j]`.

3. **Determine Communicating Servers**:
   - Scan the `grid` again and check each server (a cell with `1`).
   - A server is considered to communicate if:
     - Its row (`rows[i]`) contains more than one server, or
     - Its column (`cols[j]`) contains more than one server.
   - If either condition is true, increment the answer counter `ans`.

4. **Return the Answer**:
   - Return the total count of servers that can communicate.

### Detailed Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    const int m = grid.size();  // Get the number of rows
    const int n = grid[0].size();  // Get the number of columns
    int ans = 0;  // To store the final answer
    vector<int> rows(m);  // Array to count servers in each row
    vector<int> cols(n);  // Array to count servers in each column

    // Count the number of servers in each row and column
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (grid[i][j] == 1) {  // If there is a server at this position
          ++rows[i];  // Increment the row count
          ++cols[j];  // Increment the column count
        }
      }
    }

    // Check which servers can communicate
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (rows[i] > 1 || cols[j] > 1)) {
          // If this server's row or column has more than one server
          ++ans;  // Increment the answer
        }
      }
    }

    return ans;  // Return the total count of communicating servers
  }
};
```

### Explanation in Steps

1. **Initialization and Counting**:
   - `rows` is used to store the number of servers in each row.
   - `cols` is used to store the number of servers in each column.
   - These arrays help quickly determine whether a server can communicate with another.

2. **First Nested Loop**:
   - Scans the entire `grid`.
   - For every cell with a value of `1`, updates the count for its respective row (`rows[i]`) and column (`cols[j]`).

3. **Second Nested Loop**:
   - Scans the `grid` again to check each server (cells with a value of `1`).
   - A server can communicate if:
     - Its row (`rows[i]`) has more than one server (`rows[i] > 1`), or
     - Its column (`cols[j]`) has more than one server (`cols[j] > 1`).
   - If either condition is true, the server is included in the final count.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The final count of servers that can communicate is returned.

### Time and Space Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Counting servers in rows and columns requires scanning the entire grid, which takes \( O(m \cdot n) \).
   - Checking whether servers can communicate also requires scanning the grid, another \( O(m \cdot n) \).
   - Overall, the time complexity is \( O(m \cdot n) \).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Two additional arrays, `rows` and `cols`, are used, with sizes \( m \) and \( n \), respectively.
   - The total space complexity is \( O(m + n) \).
